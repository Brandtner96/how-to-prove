How to Prove It: A Structured Approach
------------

Contains solution for the Velleman's book.

The reason I have started studying this is to ultimately study
[type theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory).

Feel free to raise
[issue](https://github.com/psibi/how-to-prove/issues) if you think a
proof is wrong or if it needs some clarification. Pull requests and
contributions are welcome.

* [David Cantrell](https://github.com/davecan) for Section 3.3 and
various other improvements.

Notes:
-------

From Chapter 2, I have moved from markdown format to Latex as it helps
in much easier rendering of mathematical symbols. It can be compiled
using `pdflatex`:

`pdflatex tex_filename`

Although I did solve Chapter 3 problems, I haven't uploaded all of
them yet because of my laziness.
